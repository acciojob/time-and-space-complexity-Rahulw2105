	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood it is time taken by an algorithm to run and complete the given task. As programmer our goal should be to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program.For example ,If program takes an array of size n as an input ,the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).  </p>
