	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>time complexity is a crucial concept that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps determine the how  efficient of an algorithm and predict its performance as inputs grow larger.</p>
 <p> <b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of the input size. Analyzing space complexity helps determine how efficiently an algorithm uses memory, which is crucial for optimizing performance.When an algorithm has O(n) space complexity, it means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. </p>
